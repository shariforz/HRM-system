# Django-HRM-System

This app is meant to be used by HR manager to manage their hrm records:
employee data
staff
results and
finances.

It currently doesn't allow employees/staff to login.
Solely, it's expected to be used on a single machine or online for managers only.

Multi Tenant schema actively under development.
